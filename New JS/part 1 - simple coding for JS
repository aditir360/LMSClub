This is some simple and RANDOM coding for (JS) Java Script. BTW, this is a multi - line comment.

/*

// This is some small code where I will print the name and the string "Hello" together. 
name = "Sam";

console.log("Hello " + name);  // printing name on the console

// Here, I declare some variables but then I print them on the console log too. And remember, y and Y - both are considered different in JS.
let y = "hi";
let Y = 7;

console.log(y); // hi
console.log(Y); // 7

//This is just one part - there will be more!
